Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt What you expected from me, I came from the dirt (Who's the king?) Money my motivator, the songs that I sing Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go Will I return or will I burn, never know Look in my eyes and see the future But don't sugar coat it  Listen... History repeats itself and that's just how it goes Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound This year Ill prolly go to the awards dappered down Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with But not Jermaine, my aim too sick I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid And break the chains and change minds One verse at a time, and claim 2-6 And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king? [Outro] We all kings (We all kings nigga) Kings of ourselves first and foremost (True) While the people debate who's the king of this rap game Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine With every ounce of strength in his veins To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates And falls to the Earth from which it came It's done Ain't gonna be no more kings Be wary of any man that claims Because deep down he clings onto the need for power The reality, he's a coward Ultimately he's scared to die And sometimes so am I But when I'm in tune with the most high I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I Different kind of skin, different set of eyes Two different minds, but only one God (It's only one God nigga) It's for all the kings 'Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved "

Trippin\', yeah I guess she had a point, didn\'t she? A bunch of stereotypes all in my head I remember doing the math like, ""Yeah, I\'m good at little league."" A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant For those that like the same sex had the characteristics The right-wing conservatives think it\'s a decision And you can be cured with some treatment and religion Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition Playing God, aw nah, here we go America the brave still fears what we don\'t know And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago I don\'t know [Hook: Mary Lambert] And I can\'t change, even if I tried Even if I wanted to And I can\'t change, even if I tried Even if I wanted to My love, my love, my love She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm [Verse 2: Macklemore] If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me Have you read the YouTube comments lately? ""Man, that\'s gay"" gets dropped on the daily We\'ve become so numb to what we\'re sayin\' Our culture founded from oppression Yet we don\'t have acceptance for \'em Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it ""Gay"" is synonymous with the lesser It\'s the same hate that\'s caused wars from religion Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins It\'s human rights for everybody, there is no difference Live on and be yourself When I was at church they taught me something else If you preach hate at the service, those words aren\'t anointed That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen I might not be the same, but that\'s not important No freedom \'til we\'re equal, damn right I support it [Trombone Interlude] [Hook: Mary Lambert] And I can\'t change, even if I tried Even if I wanted to My love, my love, my love She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm [Verse 3: Macklemore] We press play, don\'t press pause: progress, march on! With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause \'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law Kids are walking \'round the hallway Plagued by a pain in their heart A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are And a certificate on paper isn\'t gonna solve it all But it\'s a damn good place to start No law\'s gonna change us, we have to change us Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one Strip away the fear, underneath it\'s all the same love About time that we raised up!

There\'s no way for you to even that out You can join the march, protest, scream and shout Get on Twitter, hashtag and seem like you\'re down But they see through it all, people believe you now? You said publicly, ""Rest in peace, Mike Brown"" You speak about equality, but do you really mean it? Are you marching for freedom, or when it\'s convenient?

Damn, a lot of opinions, a lot of confusion, a lot of resentment Some of us scared, some of us defensive And most of us aren\'t even paying attention It seems like we\'re more concerned with being called racist Than we actually are with racism I\'ve heard that silences are action and God knows that I\'ve been passive What if I actually read a article, actually had a dialogue Actually looked at myself, actually got involved? If I\'m aware of my privilege and do nothing at all, I don\'t know Hip-hop has always been political, yes It\'s the reason why this music connects So what the fuck has happened to my voice if I stay silent when black people are dying Then I\'m trying to be politically correct? I can book a whole tour, sell out the tickets Rap entrepreneur, built his own business If I\'m only in this for my own self-interest, not the culture that gave me a voice to begin with Then this isn\'t authentic, it is just a gimmick The DIY underdog, so independent But the one thing the American dream fails to mention Is I was many steps ahead to begin with My skin matches the hero, likeness, the image America feels safe with my music in their systems And it\'s suited me perfect, the role, I\'ve fulfilled it And if I\'m the hero, you know who gets cast as the villain White supremacy isn\'t just a white dude in Idaho White supremacy protects the privilege I hold White supremacy is the soil, the foundation, the cement and the flag that flies outside of my home White supremacy is our country\'s lineage, designed for us to be indifferent My success is the product of the same system that let off Darren Wilson guilty We want to dress like, walk like, talk like, dance like, yet we just stand by We take all we want from black culture, but will we show up for black lives? We want to dress like, walk like, talk like, dance like, yet we just stand by We take all we want from black culture, but will we show up for black lives? [Interlude 4: Various male and female voices] ""Black Lives Matter, to use an analogy, is like if... if there was a subdivision and a house was on fire. The fire department wouldn\'t show up and start putting water on all the houses because all houses matter. They would show up and they would turn their water on the house that was burning because that\'s the house that needs the help the most. My generation\'s taken on the torch of a very age-old fight for black liberation, but also liberation for everyone. Injustice anywhere is still injustice everywhere. The best thing white people can do is talk to each other, having those very difficult, very painful conversations with your parents, with your family members.
